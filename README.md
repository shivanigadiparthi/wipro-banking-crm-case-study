This repository documents a real-world style case study based on my work as a **Business Systems Analyst at Wipro** for a **banking client**.  
The focus is on:

- Redesigning the **SFTP lockbox payment process** to reduce reconciliation delays.

- Driving end-to-end delivery from **requirements gathering** to **testing and deployment**.

> **Role:** Business Systems Analyst  
> **Tech & Tools:** Siebel CRM, OBIEE, SQL, Excel, Visio/Lucidchart, Agile/Scrum  
> **Key Outcomes:**  
> - Reduced report turnaround time by ~20%.  
> - Improved payment reconciliation timeliness and accuracy.  
> - Achieved 100% functional alignment in UAT with defect-free deployment.

## Business Problem

The client, a leading retail bank, faced challenges in two critical areas:

1. **Payment Processing & Reconciliation (SFTP Lockbox)**  
   - Delayed reconciliation of customer payments.  
   - Manual interventions and frequent exceptions.  
   - Limited visibility into payment status for business teams.

2. **CRM & Reporting (Siebel + OBIEE)**  
   - Fragmented customer data across systems.  
   - Slow turnaround for management reports.  
   - Limited ability for stakeholders to self-serve key KPIs.

- Led **requirements workshops** with business, technology, and design stakeholders.
- Produced **BRDs, functional specifications, and detailed use cases** for Siebel and lockbox changes.
- Partnered with developers to refine **Siebel CRM and OBIEE data flows**.
- Coordinated **System Integration Testing (SIT)** and **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.
- Worked with the banking client to **redesign the lockbox payment process** and ensure it integrated cleanly with downstream systems.
